# Advent of Code Practice
In the spirit of practicing programming problems for interviews (and to make sure I know my language), I thought I'd do all the problems from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The goal is to do at least one two-part problem a day ðŸŽ¯

All problems will be done in JavaScript.
